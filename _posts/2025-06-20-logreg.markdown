Neuroimaging analyses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets often center around questions like, "where in the brain is activation (statistically) greater than chance under a given condition (e.g., for drug cues > neutral cues)." This is accomplished by fitting a linear model predicting activation intensity within each voxel (3-D pixel) of the brain. However, we aren't always interested in knowing the intensity of activation; sometimes, we are interested in questions about the spatial specificity of activations, like in meta-analytic contexts. 

For some additional background and details, see <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.41">this paper</a> describing the meta-analytic approach. 

Logistic regression is one approach for answering these kinds of questions. In the example below, I'll show how we can ask whether the likelihood of activation in a given voxel differs between two groups of studies, while controlling for a third characteristic. 

The function requires a meta-analytic database object (see <a href="https://github.com/canlab">CAN Lab github</a>), a series of contrast indicator maps (i.e., brain maps with binary outcomes of activation [1] or no activation [0]), and a design matrix for which the function will generate statistical estimates. The function is available <a href="https://github.com/nharp189/nrh_fMRI_tools">here</a>. 

<b>Contrast Indicator Maps</b>

The contrast indicator maps are whole-brain images indicating areas of activation extracted from published reports. For example, you can see below that a series of coordinates have been used to create 10mm spheres of activation throughout the brain.

A common approach in meta-analyses for examining how study-level characteristics influence these activations is to contrast two meta-analytic maps (e.g., comparing studies of treatment-seeking vs. non-treatment-seeking samples). However, these contrasts can be influenced by colinearity with third variables. For example, consider that there may be unequal distributions of drug types (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioids, etc.) within the treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking studies. One way to address this is to control for this third variable (or additional variables) in a logistic regression.
