Neuroimaging analyses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets often center around questions like, "where in the brain is activation (statistically) greater than chance under a given condition (e.g., for drug cues > neutral cues)." This is accomplished by fitting a linear model predicting activation intensity within each voxel (3-D pixel) of the brain. However, we aren't always interested in knowing the intensity of activation; sometimes, we are interested in questions about the spatial specificity of activations, like in meta-analytic contexts. 

For some additional background and details, see <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.41">this paper</a> describing the meta-analytic approach. 

Logistic regression is one approach for answering these kinds of questions. In the example below, I'll show how we can ask whether the likelihood of activation in a given voxel differs between two groups of studies, while controlling for a third characteristic. 

The function requires a meta-analytic database object (see <a href="https://github.com/canlab">CAN Lab github</a>), a series of contrast indicator maps (i.e., brain maps with binary outcomes of activation [1] or no activation [0]), and a design matrix for which the function will generate statistical estimates. The function is available <a href="https://github.com/nharp189/nrh_fMRI_tools">here</a>.
