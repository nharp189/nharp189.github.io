My name is Nick, and I completed my formal training as a psychologist and neuroscientist, with a particular focus in emotion and affective processes (e.g., decision-making). Altogether, I have over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in psychology research laboratories across the country. In these roles, I conceptualized, designed, and led numerous independent behavioral experiments with human subjects in the laboratory and online (e.g., using Qualtrics, RedCap), contributed to large federally funded grant projects, and developed expertise in data science and analytics, statistics, and causal inference. As a few examples, I have experience analyzing large-scale time-series data collected with magnetic resonance imaging, and I have leveraged such data in conjunction with machine learning to predict behavioral outcomes (e.g., biases in emotional decision-making). Relatedly, I have used computational models of decision-making to extract deeper insight from reaction time and binary choice data. My extensive background in human behavior will strengthen my ability to draw inferences from customer metrics and better characterize their perspectives.
