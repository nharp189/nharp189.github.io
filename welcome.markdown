My name is Nick - I am a formally trained cognitive/social psychologist and neuroscientist that is passionate about extracting meaningful insights from complex data. Altogether, I have over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in psychology and behavioral science laboratories across the country. Through these experiences, I have developed a strong background in statistics, data science, and analytics - including formal training in techniques like mixed-effect and multi-level modeling, structural equation modeling, and machine learning (ML). 
<br>
<br>
You can find a complete list of my published work <a href="https://nharp189.github.io/pubs">here</a>. As a couple of highlights, I have organized, processed, and analyzed complex, high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets, distilling functional magenetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets into condensed feature sets that represent associations in brain activation over time. From these features, I developed a predictive model of emotional decision-making behavior, and explored the predictive power of subsets of features using both data-driven and hypothesis-testing approaches. Currently, I am leading validation testing of an ML-based multivariate pattern for possible clinical use cases as an fMRI biomarker, with an eye toward potential biases in model performance (checkout the first validation test on completely independent data <a href="https://nharp189.github.io/recent/">here</a>).  
<br>
<br>
While generating actionable insights from datasets is what I find most exciting in my current role, there are many other skills that I developed during my academic career. I have conceptualized, designed, and led numerous independent behavioral experiments with human subjects in both the laboratory and online (e.g., using Qualtrics, RedCap), including randomized controlled trials that inform my approach to A/B testing. I also have extensive programming experience with R and MATLAB, and as you'll see in my upcoming posts, I'm venturing into more Python.

<!-- My area of academic expertise is "affective science," which concerns emotions and feelings.  

#I have used these skills to better understand human behavior in both clinical and general samples, to build predictive models of behavior using patterns of brain activity, and 

# My extensive background in human behavior will strengthen my ability to draw inferences from customer metrics and better characterize their perspectives.
