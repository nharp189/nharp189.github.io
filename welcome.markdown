My name is Nick - I am a behavioral scientist, formally trained in cognitive/social psychology and neuroscience, that is passionate about extracting meaningful insights from complex data. Altogether, I have over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in psychology and behavioral science laboratories across the country. Through these experiences, I have developed a strong background in statistics, data science, and analytics - including coursework and research projects with techniques like mixed-effect and multi-level modeling, structural equation modeling, and machine learning (ML).

You can find a complete list of my published work <a href="https://nharp189.github.io/pubs">here</a>. As a couple of highlights, I have organized, processed, and analyzed complex, high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets, distilling hundreds of thousands of brain activity measurements over space and time into condensed feature sets that represent associations in brain activity fluctuations. From these features, I developed a predictive model of emotional decision-making behavior, and explored the predictive power of subsets of features using both data-driven and hypothesis-testing approaches <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/34/3/bhae102/7630566">(Harp et al., 2024)</a>. Currently, I am leading validation testing of an ML-based multivariate pattern for possible clinical use cases as an neuroimaging biomarker, with an eye toward potential biases in model performance (checkout a recent poster from the first validation test on completely independent data <a href="https://nharp189.github.io/recent">here</a>, and a commentary on the approach in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00702-024-02766-2">Harp, Wager, and Kober, 2024</a>).

While generating actionable insights from data is what I find most exciting in my current role, there are many other skills that I developed during my academic career. I have conceptualized, designed, and led numerous independent behavioral experiments with human subjects in both the laboratory and online (e.g., using Qualtrics, RedCap), including randomized controlled trials that inform my approach to A/B testing. I also have extensive programming experience with R and MATLAB, and am proficient with Python and shell scripting. Additionally, I am passionate about mentoring others and collaborative work, and have supported the research of over a half-dozen trainees in my graduate and postdoctoral laboratories.

Thanks for your time, and please reach out with any questions!
<!-- My area of academic expertise is "affective science," which concerns emotions and feelings.  

#I have used these skills to better understand human behavior in both clinical and general samples, to build predictive models of behavior using patterns of brain activity, and 

# My extensive background in human behavior will strengthen my ability to draw inferences from customer metrics and better characterize their perspectives.
